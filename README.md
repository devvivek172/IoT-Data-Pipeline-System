## Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time IoT data pipeline** built with **Python**, **MQTT**, **AWS IoT Core**, and **Docker**. It securely transmits device data to the cloud, validates it, and prepares it for further processing. 

This pipeline can be used for any real-time data processing scenario, from IoT devices in industrial setups to smart home systems.

## Features
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Devices send data to AWS IoT using MQTT.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Automated Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity and accuracy.
- üê≥ **Dockerized**: Fully containerized for easy deployment anywhere.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS IoT Core Integration**: Leverages AWS IoT for secure device communication.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **CI/CD Ready**: Built with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
